By default the app works with the .txt file. However you can change the save location which works with .csv files just fine.
The drawback is that you need to change the save location everytime you run the app if you arent using the default.

In this application you can:
1. Store a list of DVD objects containing relevant info.
2. Add more dvds manually
3. Delete dvds manually
4. Edit dvd information
5. Search for dvds
6. Save and load list in a .txt or .csv
7. You can change the save and load location if you wish (although this has to be done every time the app is run if not using default)
